Superstore Dashboard Insight Story. 
Data Extraction.
The data for this visualization was obtained from kaggle website. 
It was unzipped and then download as csv file.
Data Cleaning
After the zip file was downlaoded as csv file, the csv file was then read using pd.read command 
using pandas with jupiter notebook tool. Data cleaning was done by checking for the null values, 
renaming of column and converting of column into appropriate data type. 
TRANSFORMATION AND LOADING.
After data cleaning, my data was exported using to_csv to be used for visualization.
Going in to the visualization pain, 
count of total vendors was obtained, count vendors with online presence and social media was also 
shown on our visualization pane. 
INSIGHTS.
From our dashboard, it was shown that 42 vendors have website while 83 vendors have online presence.
The dashboard also shows vendors and their mobile contact.
The reasons why we have low vendors with website   is as result of the fact that
some of those vendors are operating on a small scale and the cost of owing a website is not very friendly. It is easier for them to have social media 
account like facebook with little or no cost as against owing a website. 
This dashboard also shows vendors with the highest ratings.
